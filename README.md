# Ray tracer
Rust implementation of the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial. It has a few extra features, such as multithreaded rendering, progress bars and scene definition via JSON files.

To run, provide one or more JSON files containing the scenes to render via command line arguments. A couple of examples can be found in the `examples` folder.
